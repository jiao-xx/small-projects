# Project Title: Data Cleaning Queries

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing raw datasets using SQL queries. Effective data cleaning is essential for ensuring data accuracy and reliability in downstream analyses, such as predictive modeling and business intelligence.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Addressed missing values using imputation techniques or appropriate replacements.
  - Standardized column names and data formats for consistency.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Identified and removed duplicate records.
  - Detected and corrected outliers or erroneous data entries.
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Normalized data to ensure uniform scaling.
  - Created derived columns for enhanced analysis.
- **Optimization**:
  - Leveraged indexing and optimized SQL queries for efficient processing.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**:
  - Used for data manipulation and cleaning.

## Workflow
1. **Data Import**:
   - Loaded raw datasets into the SQL database.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Used SQL scripts to clean and transform data, including handling missing and inconsistent values.
3. **Validation**:
   - Verified data quality by checking summary statistics and applying logical constraints.
4. **Export**:
   - Saved cleaned datasets for further analysis or reporting.

## Results
- Cleaned datasets with standardized formats, free from duplicates and missing values.
- Enhanced data quality for downstream analytics and reporting.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate data cleaning workflows using SQL scripts with triggers or stored procedures.
- Add error logging and reporting for better tracking of cleaning processes.
- Integrate Python or R scripts for advanced data validation and visualization.
